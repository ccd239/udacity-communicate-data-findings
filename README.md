## Dataset

The data being explored includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

In the first part of the document, two different dataframes were developed: one that only includes trip data for the month of February 2019, and other that includes trip data for all the months of 2019. The original given data for February 2019 includes more variables than the rest of the data for the other months. So, having these 2 datasets available enabled a more broaden research about the time variables computed, such as the months of the year and the effect they have in the users behaviors.


## Summary of Findings

The distributions of member ages and the trips duration are right-skewed, meaning that most of the users are young (ages between 25 and 40 years-old) and use this bike sharing system to make short rides (8 to 15 min). The distribution of rides along the weekdays hours is bimodal: the two peaks are during the busy hours. On the other hand, the rides along the hours of a weekend day follows a normal distribution. Also, it was possible to notice that this system is used more on weekdays than during weekends.

Finally, it was possible to notice that the age does not have a linear influence on the duration of trips; the members gender does not influence the trip duration; on the contrary, the type of user and the time (time of the year and type of day, week/weekend) has impact on the average of the duration of trips.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the subscriber/users habits: when are most trips taken in terms of time of the day, day of the week and month of the year. Also, what variables affect the duration of their rides.
